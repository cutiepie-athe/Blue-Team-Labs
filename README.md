Simple-pfSense-set-up
Objective
The primary focus of this project was to gain basic familiarity of another firewall software in a virtualized environment. After pfSense set-up was complete, very simple firewall rules were created on my own in a Windows virtual machine and experimented with to primarily learn rule components, rule ordering and processing.
